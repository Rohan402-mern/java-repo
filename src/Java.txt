State Management in Front-End:

Learn Redux (in React) or Vuex (in Vue) for managing the global state of the application.

6. Microservices Architecture (Optional)
Objective: Understand the design and development of large applications using a microservices approach.
Microservices Concepts: Learn about decentralized data management, independent deployability, and inter-service communication.

Spring Cloud: Explore Spring Cloud tools like Eureka, Zuul, and Hystrix for service discovery, API gateway, and fault tolerance.

Docker & Kubernetes: Learn about containerization (using Docker) and orchestration (using Kubernetes) for scaling and deploying microservices.

7. Testing
Objective: Learn how to write tests to ensure the quality and reliability of your applications.
Unit Testing: Learn JUnit 5 for unit testing Java code.

Mocking: Use Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests.

Integration Testing: Use Spring Boot Test for integration testing.

Front-End Testing:

Jest or Mocha for testing JavaScript/React code.

Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): Learn the Red-Green-Refactor cycle and the benefits of TDD.

8. DevOps and Deployment
Objective: Learn the tools and techniques to deploy and maintain applications in production environments.
Containerization: Learn Docker to package your application and its dependencies in containers.

CI/CD: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.

Cloud Platforms: Understand how to deploy your application to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

API Gateway & Load Balancing: Implement API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway and learn about Nginx or HAProxy for load balancing.

9. Performance Optimization
Objective: Learn how to optimize the performance of both the front-end and back-end.

That's a great idea! Practicing Executor Framework problems from beginner to advanced will help you master Java's powerful multithreading capabilities.

Below is a curated list of coding problems, progressing from basic concepts to real-world concurrency scenarios, all using the Executor Framework (ExecutorService, Callable, Future, etc.).

✅ Beginner Level
🔹 1. Run Multiple Tasks in Parallel
Goal: Use ExecutorService to run 5 simple tasks that print numbers from 1 to 5.

🔸 Concepts: Runnable, Executors.newFixedThreadPool(), submit()

🔹 2. Calculate Square of Numbers in Parallel
Goal: Given an array of integers, calculate the square of each number using threads.

🔸 Concepts: Callable, Future, collect results.

🔹 3. Wait for All Tasks to Finish
Goal: Submit 3 tasks using ExecutorService. Wait for all to finish and print “All done”.

🔸 Concepts: shutdown(), awaitTermination()

🔹 4. Download URLs Simultaneously (Simulated)
Goal: Use Callable to simulate downloading 5 URLs and return "Downloaded: URL".

🔸 Concepts: Return value with Future.get()

🟡 Intermediate Level
🔹 5. Task with Tim eout
Goal: Submit a task and wait only 2 seconds for its result.

🔸 Concepts: Future.get(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

🔹 6. Cancel a Long-Running Task
Goal: Submit a task that sleeps 5 seconds. Cancel it after 2 seconds.

🔸 Concepts: Future.cancel(true), isCancelled(), Thread.interrupt()

🔹 7. Create a Thread Pool with Custom Thread Names
Goal: Use ThreadFactory to name threads like Worker-1, Worker-2.

🔸 Concepts: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(), custom ThreadFactory

🔹 8. Scheduled Task (Reminder App)
Goal: Print a reminder every 3 seconds.

🔸 Concepts: ScheduledExecutorService, scheduleAtFixedRate()

🔴 Advanced / Real-World Scenarios
🔹 9. Process Orders with Callable and Return Results
Goal: Simulate an e-commerce app: each thread processes an order and returns confirmation.

🔸 Concepts: Callable, ExecutorService, Future, real-world simulation

🔹 10. Parallel File Processing (Simulated)
Goal: Simulate reading multiple files using a thread pool, return lines read.

🔸 Concepts: Fixed thread pool, Callable, file-like simulation

🔹 11. Thread Pool Metrics Logger
Goal: Periodically log how many threads are active and tasks are completed.

🔸 Concepts: ThreadPoolExecutor, getActiveCount(), getCompletedTaskCount()

🔹 12. Producer-Consumer with Executors
Goal: Use BlockingQueue with Executors to simulate producers and consumers.

🔸 Concepts: BlockingQueue, ExecutorService, real-world coordination

🔹 13. Retry Failed Tasks with Executors
Goal: Resubmit a task if it fails up to 3 times.

🔸 Concepts: Future, try-catch, resubmission logic

🔹 14. Parallel Web Crawler (Mini Version)
Goal: Given a list of links, download them in parallel and store results.

🔸 Concepts: ExecutorCompletionService, Callable, result aggregation

📦 Bonus: Combine with Java 8+
Use Lambdas with Callable and Runnable.

Combine Streams + ExecutorService for hybrid solutions.

new -------------------------------------------

✅ Beginner Level – Getting Comfortable
1. Hello from Threads
Write a program that creates a fixed thread pool of 3 threads, and submit 5 tasks that each print "Hello from thread X" where X is the thread name.

🧠 Concepts: FixedThreadPool, Runnable, Thread naming

2. Download Simulated Files
Simulate downloading 5 files using a thread pool. Each task should sleep for 1 second and then print that the file is downloaded.

🧠 Concepts: Runnable, Executors.newFixedThreadPool, task queue

3. Shutdown Behavior
Create a program that submits 5 tasks, then calls shutdown(). Add a sixth task after shutdown and observe the result.

🧠 Concepts: shutdown, rejected tasks

🔁 Intermediate Level – Returning Results
4. Callable for Sum
Use Callable to submit a task that calculates and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

🧠 Concepts: Callable, Future, result retrieval

5. Parallel Factorials
Submit 5 factorial computation tasks using Callable. Each task should compute factorial of a number and return the result.

🧠 Concepts: Callable, multiple futures, result aggregation

6. Wait for All Results
Submit multiple Callable tasks and wait until all tasks complete, then print their results.

🧠 Concepts: Future.get(), coordination

🚦 Advanced Level – Performance and Coordination
7. Time Comparison: Sequential vs Executor
Write two versions of the same task (e.g. download 5 movies):

One using sequential execution.

One using ExecutorService.
Compare and print time taken.

🧠 Concepts: Parallelism performance

8. Fixed vs Cached Thread Pool
Submit 100 small tasks (e.g. printing or sleeping 100ms) to:

A fixed thread pool of size 5.

A cached thread pool.
Measure time difference.

🧠 Concepts: Pool types, dynamic thread growth

9. Task Timeout Handling
Submit a task that takes 5 seconds, and try to get its result with a timeout of 2 seconds.

🧠 Concepts: Future with timeout, TimeoutException

10. Race Condition with Shared Counter (Without Lock)
Use 10 threads to increment a shared counter. Observe how the final value may be incorrect due to race conditions.

🧠 Concepts: Shared state, synchronization needs

Bonus: Fix it using AtomicInteger or synchronized.

💡 Expert / Real-World Challenges
11. Web Crawler Simulation
Create a thread pool to simulate crawling 100 URLs (just sleep + print), limiting concurrency to 10.

🧠 Concepts: Bounded thread pools, task throttling

12. Producer-Consumer with Executor
Simulate a producer generating 100 tasks and consumers (executor threads) processing them.

🧠 Concepts: Thread coordination, queue management

13. Retry Failed Tasks
Submit a task that randomly fails. If it fails, resubmit it up to 3 times. Track which ones succeed.

🧠 Concepts: Retry logic, resilience, result handling

14. Order-Preserving Parallel Execution
Submit tasks that sleep random times but ensure that results are printed in the same order they were submitted.

🧠 Concepts: Result ordering, indexed future list
